        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1><hr>
        
        <h2>Front-end Devloper & SQA/SQT Engineer</h2>
        <p>My name is Basit, I am an under graduate in Bsc (cse) at Daffodil International University.I am a dedicated and hard work person instance like I wanted to become an athlete and started my training initially I was lacking in confidence in myself then I came to know that I am the best motivator and trainer of myself and started to sweat a lot and spend more time on the track, at last now I am able to achieve my daily target.
            I am a person who is ready to learn anything from anyone without any hesitancy. Being a quick learner is my strength. And I give importance to everyone and each individual as their own strength I try to get inspired by them. A true inspiration for me is my friend who is a hard worker and self-motivated person who guides me in all aspects.I engage myself in activities like swimming, cooking, meditation, drawing, listening to music etc. My weakness is I used to get emoted quickly when some of the incidents that I come across, But now, I have managed it a lot by the guidance of my friends and by reading self-help books and Podcasts.
            Thank you.</p>
